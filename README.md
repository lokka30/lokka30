Currently studying Cyber Security. üá¶üá∫

One of my pastimes programming ‚Äì primarily, I write software for Minecraft and Ace of Spades.

I am the original author of [LevelledMobs](https://github.com/ArcanePlugins/LevelledMobs), which has mostly solidified its position as a top-3 rated plugin by SpigotMC forum members. LevelledMobs has inspired a few 'clone' attempts, brought thousands of concurrent users, and became large enough of a project for me to create the [ArcanePlugins](https://github.com/ArcanePlugins) organisation (and ultimately hand over maintenance to generous contributors as my free time deteriorated).

My development 'toolkit' includes a variety of operating systems, languages, DBMSs, and whatnot. I primarily program on UNIX-like systems in Java, Kotlin, Python, C++, and C, mostly self-taught through these technologies being fantastic tools at solving problems. I also dabble in web development, Rust, C#, Windows app development, and various other technologies.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:lachy@lachy.space) if you'd like to contact *(please note, resource support is not provided there)*.

Cheers üçª
