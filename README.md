Welcome to my profile! I'm Lachlan, a Cyber Security student and software developer from Western Australia. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º

Most of my published repositories are Minecraft server modifications. This is where I began my journey with programming and maintaining libre software. I first released [PhantomCombat](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discontinued-phantomcombat.74060/), though most know me for founding the [LevelledMobs](https://github.com/lokka30/LevelledMobs/) project, which is one of the highest-rated resources on SpigotMC. I have since transferred most of my Minecraft projects to the [ArcanePlugins](https://github.com/ArcanePlugins) GitHub organisation to better facilitate community contributions and discussions. I work on my own projects (some of which are public), and I also contribute to various other projects. I'm also involved in the Ace of Spades community, contributing to [piqueserver](https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver) and [SpadesX](https://github.com/SpadesX/SpadesX).
  
I primarily write my programs (of various nature) in Java, Kotlin, Python, and C++, though I plan on learning C#, JavaScript, and other languages.

If you enjoy my work, feel free to send me feedback, and don't forget to star the repository. ;)
