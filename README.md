`cybersecurity` `programming`

I modify games (primarily Minecraft and Ace of Spades - likely how you found me here).

Original author of [LevelledMobs](https://github.com/ArcanePlugins/LevelledMobs), one of the top three highest rated plugins on SpigotMC. LM has inspired its fair share of imitations and brought thousands of concurrent servers with happy owners. I've moved most of my Minecraft software under the [ArcanePlugins](https://github.com/ArcanePlugins) org for collaboration. Thank you to [Penal](https://github.com/stumper66) and [Oath](https://github.com/UltimaOath) for carrying the torch maintaining LM.

My development 'toolkit' includes a variety of programming languages, operating systems, and other tools. I primarily program on (and for) UNIX-like systems in Java, Kotlin, Python, C++, C, Rust, and C#.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:lachy@lachy.space) if you'd like to reach out.

Cheers üçª
