Hi, I'm a student currently studying Cyber Security. In my spare time I usually work on some hobby projects, some of which ends up here. I mostly create open-source game modifications - usually Minecraft server plugins - but I also work on various other software such as discord bots and mini-projects to learn more about the programming languages I'm interested in.

Most of my programming experience is with Java, though I'm not very pleased with it. I'm gradually trying to learn other languages to find alternatives and expand my toolset.
