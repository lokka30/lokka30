# Public Projects

## Minecraft Plugins

Run a Minecraft server? You might be interested in some of my resources! Here are my favourites:

### LevelledMobs
> ### The Ultimate RPG Mob Levelling Plugin
> 
> A Bukkit plugin that makes the regular old boring mobs on your server actually difficult to fight! Brings a highly customizable experience which works seamlessly out of the box. Drag and drop solution to make your Survival / Skyblock server that much more interesting to play on.
>
> [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/levelledmobs.74304/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/lokka30/LevelledMobs)

### Treasury
> ### The Next-Era Library for Plugin Integrations
> 
> A multi-platform plugin that offers modern APIs to allow for brilliant integration between plugins. Featuring an Economy API and more planned for the future!
