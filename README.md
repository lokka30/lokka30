# Hi, I'm lokka30 👋

Here's an organised list of repositories I actively maintain:

# Minecraft Resources

## Favourites
Here are some of my more popular resources which are also my favourite.

### 💀 LevelledMobs

### 💰 ElementalEconomy

### 🤏 LittleThings
* A bunch of small things, such as putting arms on armor stands, each of which you can individually enable and configure.
* [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/littlethings.84163/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lokka30/LittleThings)

### 🛌 SleepFixer
* One-player-sleep, as if it were implemented in vanilla Minecraft
* The most lightweight, bulletproof solution on SpigotMC
* [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sleepfixer.76746/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lokka30/SleepFixer)

## Other Plugins
I work on these plugins, but they receive very low demand, and therefore few updates.

### 📈 OnlineRecord
* Logs and announces when you beat your record of online players.
* [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/onlinerecord.87390/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lokka30/OnlineRecord)

### 💂 BedDefender
* Blocks users from entering beds - used to enhance hardcore survival servers.
* [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/beddefender.84183/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lokka30/BedDefender)

## Libraries
These are resources that plugin developers can use to (hopefully) enhance their plugins.

### 🌠 MicroLib
* A small collection of Java code that I use in most of my plugins. I've designed it so other people can easily use it as well :)
* [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/microlib.84017/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/lokka30/MicroLib)

## 🏗️ Work in Progress
I'm gradually working on these shiny new resources. Expect to see them on Spigot in the future 😉

### 🖼️ ElementalMenus
* A GUI/Menu creation plugin that makes it super easy to create menus, without sacrificing great features.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/lokka30/ElementalMenus)
