I'm Lachlan, a Cyber Security student from Western Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º. I'm passionate for computer science, spending my free time creating and contributing to [libre software][6], tinkering with my homelab, and various other hobbies.
  
I write projects in Java, Python, Kotlin, SQL, Bash, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Aside from working on improving my ability in those languages, I also hope to explore C#, TypeScript, C, and PHP in the near future. There's never enough tools in your toolbox!
  
If you enjoy my work, please consider contributing (code, testing, documentation, support), or [donating](https://ko-fi.com/lokka30). Thanks :)

## Bukkit Projects
  
I'm the founder of [**ArcanePlugins**](https://github.com/ArcanePlugins), a community developing high-quality libre plugins for various server software. Most of my projects have been transferred to this organisation. We maintain several projects, here are two of those:

[![LevelledMobs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=lokka30&repo=levelledmobs&show_owner=true&theme=react)](https://github.com/lokka30/levelledmobs)
  
[![Treasury](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=lokka30&repo=treasury&show_owner=true&theme=react)](https://github.com/lokka30/treasury)

### ðŸ‘‰ [(Click here to see the rest!)](https://github.com/ArcanePlugins) ðŸ‘ˆ

I also develop a bunch of other resources outside of ArcanePlugins, these are tiny plugins such as [PhantomWorlds](https://github.com/lokka30/PhantomWorlds) and [CraftCtl](https://github.com/lokka30/CraftCtl). They're published on [SpigotMC.org][1].
  
I'm currently contributing to [Hangar](https://github.com/lokka30/Hangar), and various other projects here and there.

## Ace of Spades Projects

I'm currently contributing to [SpadesX][7] and [piqueserver][5]. I used to write scripts for pique, though I have decided to archive those and work on SpadesX instead.

## Q/A
  
<details><summary>Are you available for hire to create Minecraft resources?</summary>

No: I don't have much free time, and I'm not interested in very low-paying work, so I have decided to not be available for hire to create Minecraft resources. I much prefer to spend this time creating public open-source projects which benefit the community.
  
However, I don't speak for plenty of people on the SpigotMC and MC-Market forums who are happily available for hire.
  
</details>
  
<details><summary>I have a plugin idea, can you make it?</summary>

If the idea could benefit a decent portion of the community, I'd love to hear. Post on the [ArcanePlugins Discord guild](https://discord.gg/HqZwdcJ)'s general channel, or [PM me on SpigotMC.org](https://www.spigotmc.org/conversations/add?to=lokka30). Of course, you will be credited for the idea.
