Hi, I'm a student currently studying Cyber Security. In my spare time I usually work on hobby projects, usually my free & open-source game server modifications for Minecraft and more. I also work on various other software such as discord bots and mini-projects to learn more about the programming languages I'm interested in.

Most of my programming experience is with Java. I'm gradually trying to learn other languages to expand my toolset, such as Kotlin, which I hope can solve Java's issue of 'taking a long time to make something useful'.
